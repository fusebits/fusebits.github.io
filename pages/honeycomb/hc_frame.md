The Honeycomb Frame is an in place debugging attachment board for the Honeycomb. This is really cool beacause you can debug and test the honecomb in circuit without modifying your broadboard or protoboard layout. It just sits in between the Honeycomb and the rest of your circuit, and can be removed easily when you're done debugging.
